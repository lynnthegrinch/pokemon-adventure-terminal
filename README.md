# pokemon-adventure-terminal
hi, this is my project for the terminal adventure checkpoint.
The code should let you pick a starter and then go on a small adventure to catch some pokemon!
if you spot any errors, don't hesitate to let me know, this is my first full project in python, done completely alone from top to bottom.
